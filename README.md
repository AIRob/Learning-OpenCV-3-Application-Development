#Learning OpenCV 3 Application Development
This is the code repository for [Learning OpenCV 3 Application Development](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learning-opencv-3-application-development?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781784391454), published by [Packt](www.packtpub.com). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Building upon this, we introduce slightly more advanced image processing concepts such as filtering, thresholding, and edge detection. In the latter parts, the book touches upon more complex and ubiquitous concepts such as face detection (using Haar cascade classifiers), interest point detection algorithms, and feature descriptors. You will now begin to appreciate the true power of the library in how it reduces mathematically non-trivial algorithms to a single line of code!
##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
typedef Size_<int> Size2i;
typedef Size2i Size;
```

The book assumes a basic, working knowledge of C++. However, prior knowledge of
computer vision, image processing or machine learning is not assumed. You would need an
OpenCV 3.1 installation in your systems to run the sample programs spread across the
various chapters in this book. The set-up and installation details have already been shared.
